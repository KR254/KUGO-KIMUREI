        <h3>WIFE TRIBUTE</h3>
        <br>
        <P>
            My dear Kimulwo, we have lived for over 66 years, we have shared joyous moments and faced normal challenges in life. You were my husband, father of my children, grandfather and a great grandfather. I will miss you dearly. Rest in the Lord till we meet again  
            </P>
            <br>
        <h3>SONS TRIBUTE</h3>
        <br>
        <P>
            Dad, it is with deep sorrow to learn that you will no longer be with us. Your demise left a void none of us can ever fill. Dad you lived a life of generosity, kind heartedness and love. The memories we shared with you are a treasure that we will hold close to our hearts forever. Even though you are no longer physically with us your spirit lives on in the lessons you taught us. As we move forward in life we will carry your legacy forward by striving to be the kind of men you wanted. Psalms 147: 3 he heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. Rest in eternal peace Dad  
            </P>
            <br>

            <h3>GRANDCHILDREN TRIBUTE</h3>
            <br>
            
               <P>
                Kugo, we lack words to say but we have several memories we shared together, we remember  
                when we were young you taught us some traditional songs, poems that is "kugo chelanja piit" it 
                was laughter you always gave us advice on wealth generation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Kugo, we miss you already. When we see your staff now that you are gone, we can't believe that a 
                few days ago you were talking to us, making us laugh. Straightforward and strong, you were an 
                inspiration to us-your grandchildren. We would have wished to spend more time with you. We will 
                dearly miss you Kugo.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Kugo we miss the memories we shared together. When we used to watch the Wildlife nat Geo on 
                the Television together, you loved and enjoyed nature and animals, we could see you laugh and 
                smile so genuinely which made us so happy. We would have never imagined a life without you since 
                your presence was warm and welcoming you loved sincerely. I remember when you used to walk 
                up to the shops to buy credit sometimes we would even meet as I came from town you certainly 
                stood a symbol of strength and grace.
                </P>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Kugo you are indeed an Epitome of what love is, I remember when we came from Mwachon together and you offered me your Shuka since it was so cold, This made me cry since you were the one who needed it most yet you still gave it to me. We love you Kugo. And what we surely know as Believers is that death is just a separation from Flesh and knowing that we know you are alive in spirit and one day we will indeed meet. May your journey be filled with joy and may our bond forever thrive, your love will forever survive, Kugo you may have exited from this world but in our hearts you will surely remain. Saisere Kugo.

            Our dear father in love, you have been a beacon of light in our family, you loved us daughters in love equally as your own daughters. You never lacked pieces of advice and you treated each one of us individually, and also taught us to stay close and united.
